# ML Projects

Welcome to the `ml-projects` repository! This repository hosts a collection of my machine learning projects, each showcasing different techniques and applications in the field. Below youâ€™ll find a brief description of each project, along with links to their individual directories.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/kur0ii/breast-cancer-classification)
- **Description**: A machine learning project to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using various algorithms.
- **Techniques Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset

### [Project 2: Customer Segmentation for Optimized Marketing Campaigns](https://github.com/michaeldrm/optimization-marketing-campains)
- **Description**: This project aims to segment an organization's customers into homogeneous groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data. The goal is to enhance marketing campaigns by allowing more precise personalization of offers and promotions. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, the company can target its marketing efforts more effectively, thereby increasing the return on investment (ROI) of advertising campaigns.
- **Techniques Used**: K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering clustering to identify customer groups based on variables such as purchase frequency, amount spent, and recency of purchases. Other techniques such as  and  are also explored to compare results and refine segments. **Data normalization** and **dimensionality reduction** through PCA are also applied to improve model performance.
- **Dataset**:
